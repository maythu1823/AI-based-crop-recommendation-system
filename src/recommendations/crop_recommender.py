    Load crop data from a CSV file.

    Expected columns in the CSV:
      - crop_name: Name of the crop.
      - climate_suitability: A measure (ideally numeric) indicating how well the crop fits local climates.
      - growth_cycle: Description or length of the cropâ€™s growth cycle.

    For each crop in the DataFrame:
      - Adds the constant weather_feature from the current user input.
      - Adds the constant market_feature from the current user input.
      - Creates a binary 'preferred_flag' which is 1 if the crop is in the user's preferred list, else 0.

    Parameters:
      crop_df (pd.DataFrame): The original crop data.
      weather_feature (float): The feature value from weather data.
      market_feature (float): The feature value from market data.
