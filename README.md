🌟Overview

This project is an AI-powered crop recommendation system designed to assist farmers and greenhouse owners in making informed decisions about crop selection and resource planning.
The system collects user inputs such as location, weather conditions, greenhouse area, available water per day, and fertilizer type.
Based on these inputs, it analyzes a dataset and recommends the best three crops suitable for the user’s specific conditions.

The recommendation engine leverages machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to not only suggest crops but also estimate total cost, expected revenue, and profit margins.
This provides users with actionable insights to maximize yield and profitability while ensuring resource optimization.
